--------------------------

Netflix Prize.

KDD Cup is the first and the oldest data mining competition, and is an integral
part of the annual ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery
and Data Mining (KDD). This year's KDD Cup will be related to (but different
from) the current Netflix Prize competition. There will also be a workshop at
the KDD-2007 conference, where the participants of both the KDD Cup and the
current Netflix Prize competition will present their papers and exchange ideas.
We are looking forward to an interesting competition and your participation. We
particularly encourage the participation of students.
